### Approach

Designed around KISS Principle _Keep it simple stupid_

1. Accept __all__ parameters that _Semantic UI_ does and extends with some angular features.
2. Pass data in variables and objects (don't clutter html, use controller and services)
3. Call _Semantic UI_ js code as much as possible: __Why reinvent the wheel!__
4. _Semantic UI_ syntax looks good with angular, no need to have directive to add html classes unless really nessesary or simpifies significantly
5. Follow from last two points :If there is no _Semantic UI_ js code, there needs to be a real benefit to write angular code.

### Dependencies

- AngularJS
- semantic UI
- jQuery


### Status

I have written directive as I have needed the modules, which mean they are used live and work. If you request a directive please allow a week for me to write it.

Please put an issue if you intend to contribute your work, then I will put some effort to write the rules and guidlines etc.

\* Found AngularJS out of the box does the job well enough
\** Not sure if AngularJs is better suited or not 
\**** No javascript, so no plans unless there is a compelling reason

## Install

### Download

#### NPM

```bat
> npm install ui-angular --save
```

#### Bower

```bat
> bower install ui-angular --save
```

### Build

#### Local Build

To build inside `ui-angular` folder
- Go to ui-angular folder
- Install all needed packages `ui-angular> npm install`
- Build `ui-angular> gulp build`

#### Integrated Build

To integrate with your own gulp build
- Copy `ui-angular.json` to your build folder and set the relative paths in the file
- There must be a semantic.json file in the same folder
- add 
``` javascript
var buildUIAngular = require('[your path]/ui-angular/tasks/build')(__dirname); 
gulp.task('buildUIAngular', buildUIAngular);
```
- And integrate this with your build task

Only the the modules used for Semantic-UI will be included in the build

## Usage

### Load the Module

Use `uiAngular` to load the module. E.g.

```javascript
angular.module('app', ['uiAngular']);
```

### Common features

- All object are initiated if needed to. E.g.
 ``` javascript
$('.classes').method();
 ```


- `vm.directiveObject` Dom instance object to be used for [Semantic UI] usage. E.g.
 ``` javascript
 vm.directiveObject.method('show');
 ```

- `vm.directiveData` [Semantic UI] settings object. E.g.
 ```javascript
 vm.directiveData = {
   on: 'hover',
   onShow: function(){...}
 };
 ```
 
 
 **Warning:** Setting the variables for the method through javascript/jquery syntax will in many cases render the `ui-directive` useless, i.e.
 
 ```javascript
 $('.classes').method({
  setting: value
 });
 
 /*OR*/
 
 vm.directiveObject.method({
  setting: value,
  callBack: function(){...}
 }); 
 ```
