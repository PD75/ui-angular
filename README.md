# UI Angular

My _KISS_ -  semantic-ui/angularJS library

## About

### Approach

Designed around KISS Principle _Keep it simple stupid_

1. Accept __all__ parameters that _Semantic UI_ does, angular features are extra.
2. Pass data in variables and objects (don't clutter html, use controller and services)
3. Call _Semantic UI_ js code as much as possible: __Why reinvent the wheel!__
4. _Semantic UI_ syntax looks good with angular, no need to have directive to add html classes unless really nessesary or simpifies significantly
5. Follow from last two points :If there is no _Semantic UI_ js code, there needs to be a real benefit to write angular code.

### Dependencies

- AngularJS
- semantic UI
- jQuery


### Status

I have written directive as I have needed the modules, which mean they are used live and work. If you request a directive please allow a week for me to write it.

Please put an issue if you intend to contribute your work, then I will put some effort to write the rules and guidlines etc.

\** Not sure if AngularJs is better suited or not
